        SUMMARY: This collection presents  a  historical  survey  of  the       
        price  and  quantity of wheat produced in different localities in       
        France. The purpose of the study was to examine price trends of a       
        major  food  commodity within an important agricultural market in       
        Western Europe and, in particular,  to  measure  the  correlation       
        between  wheat price fluctuations and demographic fluctuations in       
        France. Prices and quantities  of  wheat  were  recorded,  either       
        fortnightly  or  monthly,  by local officials in the major wheat-       
        growing areas and subsequently relayed to higher  levels  of  the       
        French  government.  These  tables  of  information  were finally       
        copied and  maintained  by  the  Ministry  of  Interior  and  the       
        Ministry  of Commerce and Agriculture and ultimately deposited in       
        the French National Archives.  CLASS IV                                 
                                                                                
        UNIVERSE: All wheat  markets  in  France  for  which  prices  and       
        quantities sold were recorded by the French administration in the       
        nineteenth century.                                                     
                                                                                
        SAMPLING: A representative sample of wheat markets covering every       
        part  of  France,  with  the  exception  of Alsace-Lorraine, were       
        chosen. After eliminating  those  with  imprecise  or  incomplete       
        information,  53  markets  comprised the final list. The northern       
        half of France is more heavily represented since wheat production       
        is more extensive there than in the south. Usually one market per       
        "departement" (administrative area), either that of  the  largest       
        city  or  of  the  center with the largest quantity of sales, was       
        chosen for inclusion in  the  collection.  In  addition,  several       
        large ports, such as Cherbourg and Dieppe, and other cities, such       
        as Chateaudun and Albi, were also included.                             
                                                                                
        NOTE: These data are stored in a machine-readable tabular  format       
        with  blanks  used  to  separate  elements within the tables. The       
        files containing these data also include instructions for reading       
        the tables.
